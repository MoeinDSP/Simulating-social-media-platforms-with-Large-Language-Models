We will utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate human behavior on social media platforms. 
They will generate realistic interactions, trends, and engagement patterns based on AI-agents powered by LLMs. 
By analyzing user behaviors, sentiment, and content dynamics, the project will explore how AI mimics social interactions and the potential biases involved.
We will evaluate the realism of the generated environment to assess its accuracy and effectiveness in replicating real-world social media dynamics
