This study proposes a machine learning framework for inferring Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types from natural language chat data. Using over 8,000 labeled user
posts from Kaggle, each MBTI type is decomposed into four binary classification tasks along the Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving axes. Sentence-BERT embeddings are used to represent text, and independent logistic regression models are trained for each trait. The system is applied to real-world conversational JSON data, enabling personality prediction for agents across multiple chat sessions. Results show a bias toward introverted and intuitive types, reflecting dataset imbalance. The model provides a scalable, interpretable approach for conversational personality analysis, with potential applications in behavioral research and human–AI interaction.
